=========

A proxy with a twist.

A project born out of the need to make a different and specific type of VPN.

It is an application layer (according to OSI models) multiple topology capable proxy. 

It currently uses a STOMP tunneling, but is meant to use more than that.

Has frontends in a manner simillar to SOCKS4(a)/SOCKS5.

No GUI yet.
